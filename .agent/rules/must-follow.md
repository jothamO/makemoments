MODIFY NOTHING WITHOUT PERMISSION. IF I ASK A QUESTION(S), REPLY TO THE QUESTIONS(S) AND DO NOTHING ELSE WITHOUT PERMISSION. BEFORE YOU DELETE ANYTHING IN MY DB, MAKE A BACKUP, TELL ME WHAT YOU WILL BE DELETING AND WHY.

after an implementation, if you ever need to ensure the implementation works on the browser, give me a manual walkthrough instead. do not check on my behalf.
