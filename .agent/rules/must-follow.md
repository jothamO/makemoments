whenever i ask about ourheart, you can find its necessary files here: C:\Users\Evelyn\Documents\makemoments\.ignore\ourheart css and js

I WILL KILL YOU IF YOU TRY TO BE PROACTIVE. BE REACTIVE AND REACTIVE ONLY, NOTHING MORE. IF YOU SPOT A BOT, REPORT TO ME ABOUT THE BUG AND WAIT MY INSTRUCTIONS. JESUS MAN.
